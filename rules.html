- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds<br><br>
- In each turn, a player rolls two dices as many times as he whishes. Both Dice result gets added to his ROUND score<br><br>
- BUT, if the player rolls a '1' among any of two dices or the player rolls '6' in both of the dices , all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn<br><br>
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn<br><br>
- You can maually set the Winning Score by typing in 'Set Winning Score'. If not set manually then it would be default set to 100.<br><br>
- The first player to reach the Winning Score points on GLOBAL score wins the game.<br><br>
